# 96rp_storages
<h2>Rent or buy an item-storage and give acces to your friends with a password</h2>
<p>
  This is a pre-release!<br>
  But, everything is working. I just want to add some things<br>
  and check if my freestyle code is 100% secured :D<br>
  Right now, you need players with a job for handling<br>
  the storages. I want to add an automation system<br>
  if you dont want storages being managed by players<br>
  More in "todo"
