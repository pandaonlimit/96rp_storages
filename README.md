# 96rp_storages
<h2>Rent or buy an item-storage and give acces to your friends with a password</h2>
<p>
  Everyone can use and modify this resource for free!<br>
  Credits would be cool ofc :)<br>
  This script was made with QBX, ox_inventory and <a href="https://github.com/smirnoff647/96rp_npc">96rp_npc</a> (Dependencies)
</p>
<p>
  This is a fully working storages management script.<br>
  Its secured against "hackers" and tested!<br>
  But i have tested it at short intervals and will put it<br>
  on our server soon to find bugs and other errors<br>
  You can add a job for players to manage your storages or/and<br>
  let the storages being handled by my script without any player interaction.<br>
  I will add a video in the near future where i can explain and show<br>
  all the features.<br>
  <b>Installation guide and setup help comming soon<br>
  More in "todo"</b>
